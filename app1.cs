// Beginning with C# 14 and .NET 10, you can create file-based apps, which simplifies building and running C# programs.
// You use the dotnet run command to run a program contained in a single *.cs file.
// For example, if the following code is stored in a file named app1.cs, you can run it by typing dotnet run app1.cs.

// dotnet app1.cs

Console.WriteLine("This is app1.");
